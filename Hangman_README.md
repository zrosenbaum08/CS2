This Hangman program carries out a game of hangman with a user by taking a random word from a txt file and allowing the user to guess. The user will input a letter as a guess and the program will tell user if it is or is not in the word and makes the hangman display. The user will continue this until you win or lose. If the user inputs "a" and it is not in the word, it will display:

THAT LETTER IS NOT A PART OF THE WORD
YOU HAVE 5 LIVES
Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Guessed letters:  a
