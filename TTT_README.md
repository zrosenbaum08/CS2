This program creates the game tic-tac-toe for a user to play. The user can either play against the computer or another user. The user will choose where to go on the board and 
the next player will go. This will continue until a player has gotten 3-in-a-row or the board gets full. For this assingment, I worked with visual arrays to complete a 2 dimensional
game.
