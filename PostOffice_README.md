The Post Office program calculates the cost of shipping a package from on place to another. The user will input the 
height, length, thickness in inches and the starting and final zipcode. The code will then give the user the amount of money in 
USD. For example, if the user inputs, "4, 6, .3, 06830, 81435" the computer will output, "3.95". When running, one must separate 
each value with a comma
